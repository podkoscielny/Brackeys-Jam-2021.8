## About this game

You play as a **bird** and your goal is to **mark** with your _bombs_ as many people as possible, until you get caught by the police.\
**Jump** around buildings, **avoid** enemy bullets, and **eat** as much corn as you can to upgrade your **"weapon"**.

### Be free, don't let them put you into the cage!
